Questions: 
Why does my hero text not wrap?

The spacing of my navbar is strange...

When I upload my files from VS Studio to Git- I ALWAYS have broken image paths that I have to fix. They work fine in VS studio in live server but always break when I display them on GitPages- does anyone know why this consistently would happen?

This is my first time going from nothing to trying to create something responsive- any feedback is helpful!
